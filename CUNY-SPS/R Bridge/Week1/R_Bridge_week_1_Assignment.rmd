```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Please create the following exercises in .rmd format, publish to rpub and submit both the .rmd file and the rpub link.



1. Write a loop that calculates 12-factorial  
```{r}

v <- 12
res <- 1
while (v != 1) {
res <- res * v
   	v <- v - 1
   	print(res)
}

```

2.	Show how to create a numeric vector that contains the sequence from 20 to 50 by 5.  
```{r}
seq(from=20, to=50, by=5)
```

3.	Create the function “quadratic” that takes a trio of input numbers a, b, and c and solve the quadratic equation. The function should print as output the two solutions. 
```{r}
# Solve: 5x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0

quadratic <-function(a, b, c) {
  #quadratic formula
  D = (b*b - 4*a*c)**0.5
  x_1 = (-b + D)/(2*a)
  x_2 = (-b - D)/(2*a)
  
  paste("Answer: x=", x_1, "or x=", x_2)
}

quadratic(5,6,1)

```
